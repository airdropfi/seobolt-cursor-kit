# Link outreach (drafts only)

Follow the `seo-agent-rules` skill (`skills/seo-agent-rules/SKILL.md`) for every step; read it first if it is not loaded. Never send email or DMs, never fill contact forms, never offer payment for links. The human sends from their own mailbox.

## 1. Targets

1. `seo_projects` for the project id and domain.
2. `seo_brand_mentions` with the project id: pages that mention the brand (pass `scan: false` to reuse stored results from a recent scan). Keep the **unlinked** mentions; they are the easiest asks.
3. `seo_link_prospects` with the project id and 1-3 competitor domains (ask the human if none are known): domains linking to competitors but not to the site.
4. List inclusion: pages ranking for "best <category>" style queries (top results from `seo_keyword_difficulty`, plus the chase list from the latest `seo-geo/` report) that already list a competitor and were updated in the last 12 months.

## 2. Contacts

For each target without a contact, call `seo_find_contact` with its URL and the site's own domain as `excludeDomain`. Use only emails or contact pages the tool returns. If it finds nothing, write "not found"; never guess an address.

## 3. Prioritise

Order: unlinked mentions, then list inclusion, then competitor linkers. Within each group sort by DR (`seo_domain_rating` when the tool output lacks it). Cap the batch at 20 targets.

## 4. Draft

Write one short email per target:

- Subject names their page, not the user's product.
- First line references the exact mention or list on their page.
- One honest ask: link the existing mention to `<url>`, or consider adding the product to the list with a one-line factual description.
- No payment offer, no link swap pressure, no invented praise or numbers.

## 5. Save and hand off

Save `seo-outreach/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with a table (target URL, type, contact and where it was found, DR, status: draft) followed by the drafts. Reply with the file path and a reminder that the human reviews and sends each email personally.
